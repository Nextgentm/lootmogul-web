                    We treat data as an asset that must be protected against
                    loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different
                    security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized
                    access by members inside and outside the company. We do not
                    recommend transfer of sensitive information (such as a
                    credit card number and bank account details) via the Site to
                    other Users. Users are recommended to do so offline, on the
                    phone or via personal emails. We follow generally accepted
                    industry standards to protect the personal information
                    submitted to us, both during transmission and once We
                    receive it. However, “perfect security” does not exist on
                    the Internet. You therefore agree that any security breaches
                    beyond the control of our standard security procedures are
                    at your sole risk and discretion.

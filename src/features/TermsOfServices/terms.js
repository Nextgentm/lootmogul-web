<span style="color:white;  font-size:30px; font-family:Blanch;">COMPLAINT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS<br></span>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</span><br>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">This Section applies to any Dispute except for Disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, action or other controversy between you and us concerning these Terms, the Services or any product, service or information we make available to you, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance or any other legal or equitable basis. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law. In the event of a Dispute, you or we must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested.</span><br>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">You must send any Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to 3301 Ocean Park Blvd, #205 Santa Monica, CA-90405. We will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and we will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, either you or we may commence arbitration. You may also litigate any Dispute in small claims court in your county of residence or Santa Monica, California, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You may litigate in small claims court whether you negotiated informally first.</span><br><br>
<span style="color:white;  font-size:30px; font-family:Blanch;">BINDING ARBITRATION<br></span>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">If you and we do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this Section. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.</span><br><br>
<span style="color:white;  font-size:30px; font-family:Blanch;">CLASS ACTION WAIVER<br></span>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor we will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. If this waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then it will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration..</span><br><br>
<span style="color:white;  font-size:30px; font-family:Blanch;">ARBITRATION PROCEDURE<br></span>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">If you are located within the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom or the European Union, or any of their territories, then any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. You and we each agree to commence arbitration only in Santa Monica, California, USA. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a Dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. If you are located in a country other than listed above, then arbitration will be conducted by the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) pursuant to UNCITRAL rules, and the arbitration shall be conducted in English and the English version of these Terms (and not any translation) shall control, and both parties hereby agree to accord this arbitration agreement the broadest scope admissible under applicable Laws, and that it shall be interpreted in a non-restrictive manner. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the arbitrators’ commercial rules. The arbitrator may award compensatory damages but shall NOT be authorized to award non-economic damages, such as for emotional distress, or pain and suffering or punitive or indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. Each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees, cost and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrator and AAA; however, the arbitrator may award to the prevailing party reimbursement of its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (including, for example, expert witness fees and travel expenses), and/or the fees and costs of the arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written award and a written statement of decision describing the material factual findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. Judgment on the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties waive their right to commence any action or judicial proceeding in connection with a dispute hereunder, except for purposes of: (i) recognition and/or enforcement of the arbitration award or any other decision by the arbitral tribunal, (ii) obliging the other party to participate in the arbitration proceedings, (iii) requesting any type of conservative or interim measure in connection with the dispute prior to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, (iv) requesting the appearance of witnesses and/or experts, and/or (v) requesting that any information and/or documentation discovery be complied with. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, you understand that you are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a claim or Dispute were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, the right bring a claim as a class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and the right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence.</span><br><br>
<span style="color:white;  font-size:30px; font-family:Blanch;">CLAIMS OR DISPUTES<br></span>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">Claims or Disputes must be filed within one year. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claim or Dispute under these Terms must be filed within one year from the date of the cause of action. If a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.</span><br><br>
<span style="color:white;  font-size:30px; font-family:Blanch;">EQUITABLE RELIEF<br></span>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">You agree that we would be irreparably damaged if these Terms were not specifically enforced. Therefore, in addition to any other remedy we may have at law, and notwithstanding our agreement to arbitrate Disputes, we are entitled without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to seek appropriate equitable remedies with respect to your violation of these Terms in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span><br><br>
<span style="color:white;  font-size:30px; font-family:Blanch;">LANGUAGE OF THE TERMS<br></span>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">If we provide a translated version of these Terms, the User Terms of Service, the Developer Terms and Conditions of Service, the Affiliate Program Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy, or any other terms or policy, it is for informational purposes only. If the translated version means something different than the English version, then the English meaning will be the one that applies.</span><br><br>
<span style="color:white;  font-size:30px; font-family:Blanch;">INDEMNIFICATION<br></span>
<span style="color:#C7C7C7; font-size:16px; font-family:sora;">By entering the contest and accessing the Loot Mogul services provider therein, User agree to fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the, employees, partners, associates and licensors from and against all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, cost and expenses including legal fees and any other charges whatsoever, howsoever caused, that may arise as a result of ;</span><br><br>
